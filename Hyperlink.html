                <h2>Top websites</h2>
                <p>html is an absolute reference. Absolute references always begin with the protocol name.
An absolute reference is the complete address to a web page, just as you'd use in the
browser's address bar.There's no protocol (the part) and no address at all, just a filename.
This is a relative reference. Relative references work by assuming the address of the current page.
When the user clicks , the browser sees no protocol, so it assumes that market.html is in the same
directory on the same server as Relative references work like directions. For example, if you're in
 a lab and ask where the water fountain is, someone might say, “Go out into the hallway, turn left,
  and turn left again at the end of the next hallway.” Those directions get you to the water fountain 
  if you start in the right place. If you're somewhere else and you follow these directions, you won’t find the water fountain. </p>

                        </ul>
                <p>Advantages With absolute URLs, instead of four duplicates of the site, there will only be one
                     resource indexed by the search engine. If Google encounters problems on the site,
                      then the most logical solution for the search engine would be to simply leave the
                       website. Absolute URLs can help you avoid this</p>
